Because of my dorky, dreamy attachment to Greece, I really think I got more out of the trip than my traveling companions. All 42 of them. Yes Shalloners, you read that corretly--I was in Greece with 42 new BFFs. Forty two. I knew no one but my friend Wen-Wen, who knew 4 people, who knew more, who knew more. So it was cliques within cliques, from all over the world--12 from Singapore, 14 from London, 6 from New York, 2 from LA, 3 from Germany, 1 from Dubai, several Aussies, a French girl, and a few Kiwis.
