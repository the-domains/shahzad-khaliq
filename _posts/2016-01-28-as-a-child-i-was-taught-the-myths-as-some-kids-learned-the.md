As a child, I was taught the myths as some kids learned the Bible. I don't necessarily call myself a Pagan at parties, and I almost never sacrifice goats during the full moons (anymore) but I definitely believe in Hera, Zeus, and all the heroes of the Trojan War--to me it's just so much cooler!  So for me, my trip to Mykonos was trip was something of a holy pilgrimage. I was going to swim in the sea that Achilles crossed! Walk through Diana's forests! Eat my weight in baklava!!
