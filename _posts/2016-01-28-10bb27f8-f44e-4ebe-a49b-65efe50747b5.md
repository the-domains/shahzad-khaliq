It was so refreshing and invigorating to be around so many international people! So many different experiences and points of view and reality stars that I'd never even heard of before!!

You know, I live in New York City, there's no shortage of fascinating people. And yet I find myself ensconced in the same social circles going to the same types of places talking about the same types of things. This trip made me realize that (obvs) there's a whole lot of world outside of Manhattan...but there's also so much world 

_inside _

it too. It really inspired me to get out of my comfort zone right here in NYC.

Although one thing that I

_definitley _

won't find here in the city? A five-villa compound overlooking the entire island. Yes, our digs were the Zinas Villas, a $10 million property sat on the highest point in Mykonos.
