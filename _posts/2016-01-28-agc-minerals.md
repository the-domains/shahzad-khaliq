Fine jewelry brand Crow's Nest illustrates key elements from Walt Disney's upcoming blockbuster Maleficient with something sparkling! A limited-edition collection of jewelry was created exclusively for the film starring Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning.

Thorns, horns, dragons, feathers and fire have been translated into an exquisite seven-piece collection of statement rings, bracelets and ear cuff. Each intricate piece is set in rhodium with black diamonds, featuring a pear shaped onyx stone in contrast to green tsavorite. The hero fire ring is set with red and yellow sapphires in gold.

"The Maleficent collection has enabled me to create a collection that is dramatic and beyond anything I could have ever imagined. It's fierce," said Belevitch, who is also the founder and creative director of Crow's Nest.

Maleficient is directed by double Oscar winning director Robert Stromberg. It explores the untold story of Disney's most iconic villain from the classic
